Patient Medical Record

Patient Name: White, Alan Joseph

Age: 60

Gender: Male

Date of Admission: 2024-07-01

Date of Discharge: 2024-07-07

Chief Complaint

Severe chest pain
Shortness of breath

History of Present Illness

Alan White, a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, presented to the emergency
department with complaints of severe chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. The pain began approximately one
hour before arrival and was not relieved by his usual medications. He also reported shortness of breath and a productive
cough with dark sputum. An ECG performed in the ED showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, indicating a
possible myocardial infarction.

He has a history of three prior coronary artery bypass graft surgeries and has been experiencing occasional episodes of
angina, particularly with exertion, over the past few weeks. His medical history is also significant for diabetes mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, and a 60-pack-year smoking history.

Diagnoses

Acute STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction)
Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)
Asthma exacerbation
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures

Cardiac Catheterization
Placement of a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery

Hospital Course

Alan White was admitted to the coronary care unit for management of an acute STEMI. He was immediately started on a
heparin drip and given a loading dose of clopidogrel. Cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a 98% occlusion of
the LAD artery, which was treated with the placement of a drug-eluting stent. Post-procedure, he was monitored for
recurrent chest pain and arrhythmias.

During his hospital stay, he developed supraventricular tachycardia, which was managed with IV diltiazem. He also
experienced an asthma exacerbation, requiring nebulized bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Additionally, he was found to
have a partially occlusive DVT in the left femoral vein, which was treated with anticoagulation therapy.

His hospital course was complicated by episodes of chest pain and tachycardia, but these were managed effectively with
medications. By the time of discharge, his chest pain had resolved, and his vital signs were stable. He was discharged home
with instructions to follow up with his cardiologist and primary care physician.
