"WHITE, ALAN JOSEPH DOB 06/25/1964 ADM 07/01/2024 DIS 07/07/2024 MRN 85611550\nPatient Medical Record\n\nPatient Name: White, Alan Joseph\n\nAge: 60\n\nGender: Male\n\nDate of Admission: 2024-07-01\n\nDate of Discharge: 2024-07-07\n\nChief Complaint\n\nSevere chest pain\nShortness of breath\n\nHistory of Present Illness\n\nAlan White, a 60-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension, presented to the emergency\ndepartment with complaints of severe chest pain that radiated to his jaw and left arm. The pain began approximately one\nhour before arrival and was not relieved by his usual medications. He also reported shortness of breath and a productive\ncough with dark sputum. An ECG performed in the ED showed ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, indicating a\npossible myocardial infarction.\n\nHe has a history of three prior coronary artery bypass graft surgeries and has been experiencing occasional episodes of\nangina, particularly with exertion, over the past few weeks. His medical history is also significant for diabetes mellitus,\nhyperlipidemia, and a 60-pack-year smoking history.\n\nDiagnoses\n\nAcute STEMI (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction)\nSupraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)\nAsthma exacerbation\nDeep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)\n\nMajor Surgical or Invasive Procedures\n\nCardiac Catheterization\nPlacement of a drug-eluting stent in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery\n\nHospital Course\n\nAlan White was admitted to the coronary care unit for management of an acute STEMI. He was immediately started on a\nheparin drip and given a loading dose of clopidogrel. Cardiac catheterization was performed, revealing a 98% occlusion of\nthe LAD artery, which was treated with the placement of a drug-eluting stent. Post-procedure, he was monitored for\nrecurrent chest pain and arrhythmias.\n\nDuring his hospital stay, he developed supraventricular tachycardia, which was managed with IV diltiazem. He also\nexperienced an asthma exacerbation, requiring nebulized bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Additionally, he was found to\nhave a partially occlusive DVT in the left femoral vein, which was treated with anticoagulation therapy.\n\nHis hospital course was complicated by episodes of chest pain and tachycardia, but these were managed effectively with\nmedications. By the time of discharge, his chest pain had resolved, and his vital signs were stable. He was discharged home\nwith instructions to follow up with his cardiologist and primary care physician.\n\nPage 1\nWHITE, ALAN JOSEPH DOB 06/25/1964 ADM 07/01/2024 DIS 07/07/2024 MRN 85611550\n\nLab Results\nTest                       Result             Normal Range\nComplete Blood Count (CBC)\nWBC                        9.5 x10^9/L        4.0-11.0 x10^9/L\nRBC                        4.7 x10^12/L       4.2-5.9 x10^12/L\nHemoglobin                 14.2 g/dl.         13.5-17.5 g/dL\nHematocrit                 42%                38-50%\nPlatelets                  220 x10^9/L        150-450 x10^9/L\nBasic Metabolic Panel (BMP)\nSodium                     140 mmol/L         135-145 mmol/L\nPotassium                  4.1 mmol/L         3.5-5.0 mmol/L\nChloride                   102 mmol/L         98-107 mmol/L\nBicarbonate                24 mmol/l.         22-29 mmol/L..\nBUN                        18 mg/dL           7-20 mg/dL\nCreatinine                 1.1 mg/dl..        0.6-1.2 mg/dl.\nGlucose                    98 mg/dL           70-99 mg/dL\nLipid Panel\nTotal Cholesterol           183 mg/dL          < 200 mg/dL\nTriglycerides              138 mg/dl.         < 150 mg/dL.\nHDL                        54 mg/dL           > 40 mg/dL.\nLDL                        101 mg/dL          <100 mg/dL\nHbA1c                      8.1%               4.0-5.6%\nTroponin I                 2.25 ng/mL         < 0.04 ng/mL\n\nPhysical Exam\nGeneral: Alert, oriented, and in mild distress due to chest pain.\nVital Signs:\nTemperature: 101°F\nHeart Rate: 110 bpm\nBlood Pressure: 140/90 mmHg\nRespiratory Rate: 20 breaths per minute\nOxygen Saturation: 94% on room air\n\nHead and Neck: No jugular venous distension, carotid pulses normal, no lymphadenopathy.\nCardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, S1 and S2 present, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.

"Discharge Note:\n\nThe patient, Jane Doe, is cleared for discharge today. Her hypertension is well-controlled. She is to continue her Lisinopril 20 mg once daily. We discussed starting Ozempic for her diabetes, but will defer this to her primary care physician. She should restart her Atorvastatin 40 mg at night. For her anxiety, she has been given a new prescription for Sertraline 50 mg daily. Regarding her recent bout of bronchitis, she has completed her course of Azithromycin and does not need to continue it. She should, however, complete her steroid taper by taking Prednisone 10 mg daily for 3 days, then 5 mg daily for 3 days, then stop. She has an allergy to sulfa drugs.","llm-rubric:Your primary goal is to verify if the LLM output contains all required medical information, even if the JSON formatting isn't a perfect single array.
