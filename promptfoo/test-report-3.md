History Of Presenting Illness
Mr. Ruiz, a 47-year-old male, presents as a transfer from an outside hospital for management of
mediastinitis and persistent Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) bacteremia. Onset: The patient initially presented to the outside hospital on ___ with a 6-day
history of generalized malaise, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and intermittent chest discomfort. Location:
The patient was found to have a large fluid collection in the mediastinum at the sternotomy site, with
concern for extension to the pericardium. Duration: Symptoms had been present for approximately 6 days
prior to initial presentation. Character: The patient reported generalized malaise and chest discomfort.
Alleviating/Aggravating Factors: Not specified in the provided information. Radiation: The mediastinal fluid
collection was noted to potentially extend to the pericardium. Timing: Symptoms were persistent for 6
days before seeking medical attention. Severity: Not explicitly stated, but the presence of bacteremia and
mediastinitis suggests a severe condition. Associated Symptoms: The patient experienced nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea in addition to the primary complaints. At the outside hospital, the patient was
found to be bacteremic, growing both GBS and MRSA in blood cultures. Imaging studies, including a CT
chest, revealed a large fluid collection in the mediastinum with concern for extension to the pericardium
and purulent drainage. The patient was transferred to the current facility for further evaluation and
management by cardiothoracic surgery.

mediastinum on admission day. 2. Placement of VAC dressing post-debridement. 3. Antibiotic therapy:
Daptomycin 1000mg IV daily for MRSA and Cefepime 2g IV q8h for GBS (after desensitization). 4.
Management of acute kidney injury with IV fluids and close monitoring. 5. Temporary pacemaker
placement for management of bradycardia. 6. Daily wound checks and dressing changes. 7. Intensive
insulin management for glycemic control. 8. Cardiology follow-up for management of heart failure (EF
45%). 9. Physical and occupational therapy for mobility and strengthening. 10. Gradual improvement in
inflammatory markers and resolution of bacteremia.
